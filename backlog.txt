2do before send it to Nanyi
- change GET to POST to avoid logging messages in webserver logs
- use cofacts to search normal facebook feed post texts

- i18n
- add option to only check urls (so no message texts will be sent)
- improve settings page: should have debug mode with all current options, and normal mode showing the option to check urls only or all messages, and maybe later an option to share data with us or not.
- use TfIdf on server to check query/article similarity

- settings popup is not showing in messenger.com
- widget should be about double size in messenger.com
- icon alignment in messenger is slightly off
- modify gql query to only get the data we need
- fix css error when opening settings
- test article similarity instead of just using the first
- add confirmation dialog before sending reply
- use FB's "reply to" feature to reply to a specific earlier message
- research good, non-confrontational message texts
- cleanup Heroku app example code
- move Heroku app to own server (?)
- tighten CORS security in Heroku app (currently allows all origins)
- show user name of person/group we will send the message to in the popup (maybe not necessary anymore, it seems pretty reliable and clear who we're sending to)
